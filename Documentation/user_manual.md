# BMI Project User Manual

## BMI Distribution Charts

1. By Gender: Select "By Gender" from the dropdown menu to visualize the distribution of BMI across genders. The chart displays the frequency of BMI values categorized by gender, allowing users to observe any differences in BMI distribution between males and females.  

2. By State: Choose "By State" from the dropdown menu to view the distribution of BMI across different states. The chart presents a box plot showing the variation in BMI values among different states, facilitating comparisons of BMI distribution across geographical regions.


3. By Age: Opt for "By Age" from the dropdown menu to explore the relationship between age and BMI. The scatter plot illustrates how BMI varies with age, enabling users to observe trends or patterns in BMI distribution across different age groups.


## Adding New Entry

1. Input New Data: In the "What is your BMI?" section, enter your name, height, weight, gender, state, and birth date into the respective input fields.
   
2. Calculate BMI: Once you've provided the necessary information, the BMI for the new entry will be automatically calculated and displayed. The BMI category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese) will also be determined based on the calculated BMI value.
   
3. dd Entry: Click the "Add Entry" button to include your data in the dataset. Upon successful addition, a success message will be displayed confirming the addition of the new entry.
